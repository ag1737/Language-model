Researched and tested performance BERT, BART and T5 models as zero-shot sequence classifiers.
Communicated my findings to my team and lead a discussion with members coming to a collaborative
decision on what model to fine tune.

Fine tuned A DeBERTA model for a sequence classifier, creating the companies first in house model. Fine
tuning with Python, Pytorch, Hugging Face, and generating synthetic train and test data using ChatGPT, this
resulting in a fine tuned model with a 92% accuracy of classifying prompts into industries. 



Here I have downloaded and finetuned a language model for sequence classification.

First cells are data processing. 

Download "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"

trains on synthetic data generated by ChatGPT.

I then see the resulted classification of an example input, 

Then test on 108 prompts and 94.4% accuracy
